# Bash Scripting — Learning & Practice

This repository documents my hands-on learning of **Bash scripting** through small programs, experiments, and iterative improvements.

The goal is not to showcase “perfect” code, but to build a solid understanding of Bash by writing real scripts, refactoring them, and applying best practices over time.

## What this repository is
- A structured log of learning Bash fundamentals and common shell patterns
- Practical scripts built while studying topics like loops, conditionals, text processing, and automation
- Ongoing improvements as my understanding deepens

## What this repository is NOT
- A production-ready Bash toolkit
- A curated library of best-in-class scripts
- A demonstration of expert-level shell scripting

## Structure
```
.
├── basics/        # Core Bash concepts (variables, loops, conditionals, functions)
├── scripts/       # Small but practical scripts built from learned concepts
├── notes/         # Short notes and gotchas discovered while learning
└── README.md
```

## Learning approach
- Prefer writing scripts over passively reading
- Refactor older scripts as new concepts are learned
- Keep commits meaningful and descriptive
- Focus on correctness, clarity, and progressive improvement

## Topics covered
- Bash syntax and shell builtins
- Loops, conditionals, and functions
- File and directory manipulation
- Text processing tools (`grep`, `sed`, `awk`)
- Error handling and defensive scripting
- Script readability and maintainability

## Usage
Scripts in this repository are primarily for learning purposes.  
They may lack edge-case handling and are not guaranteed to be safe for production use.

Review code carefully before running any script.

## Progress
This repository evolves alongside my Bash learning journey.  
Earlier scripts may be revisited and improved as new techniques are learned.
